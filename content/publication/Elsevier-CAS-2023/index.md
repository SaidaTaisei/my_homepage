abstract: "In this paper, a Gaussian process regression surrogate model with transfer learning (TL-GPRSM) is introduced to reduce the computational cost of structural reliability analysis by using the input–output relationship of the source analysis having similarities with that of the target analysis. In addition, automatic relevance determination (ARD) is introduced for providing the explainability of the constructed model and confidence assurance of transfer learning. Two verifications were conducted: (i) the surrogate modeling of the live-load performance analysis of a steel bridge with corrosion by applying the source analysis in the undamaged condition and (ii) seismic performance analysis of a bridge pier, which required nonlinear time-history analyses for various earthquake loads. The results showed that TL-GPRSM was especially effective in surrogate modeling of the performance analysis with linear numerical calculations. Moreover, it was shown that the effectiveness of transfer learning in each modeling and explainability of the constructed model could be discussed based on the contributions of the model parameters estimated through ARD."

## Introduction
Structural performance evaluation requires reliability analysis wherein the limit state capacity is statistically derived. It is useful to evaluate the performances of existing structures by considering the actual structure conditions to develop maintenance plans or implement reinforcement/retrofit activities in disaster events. Statistical performance analysis requires the consideration of the uncertainties of the structural properties using Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. The MC calculations require several to ten thousands of numerical calculations with a random sampling of the input parameter space. In modeling an existing structure with deteriorations or damages, a detailed model is required to represent the damage to the structural member; therefore, the number of model parameters becomes large. Moreover, the properties to consider the uncertainties due to the deterioration or damage should be included in addition to the uncertainties of the nominal model properties. In the case of performance evaluation under a disaster load such as an earthquake load, the MC calculations of multiple input load cases should be combined to consider the input load uncertainty. Therefore, high calculation effort is required to assess the structural performance.
The surrogate model is a regression model that alternates the numerical analysis constructed using training data created through design of experiments (DoE) sampling of uncertain input parameters. The total cost of MC calculation can be reduced if a small amount of training data can appropriately represent the input–output relationship of the target numerical analysis. Numerous studies have been conducted on the application of the surrogate model to structural reliability analysis. The first application of surrogate model for the structural reliability analysis was shown by Bucher and Bourgund [1], where the performance function was approximated by the response surface method (RSM). The RSM has then been improved in many approaches, e.g., in studies by Kim et al. [2] and Zhao et al. [3]. Recently, support vector machine [4,5], polynomial chaos expansion [6,7], and artificial neural network (ANN) [8–10] are often adopted for surrogate modeling, and their effectiveness has been demonstrated. For instance, Marelli and Sudret [7] showed that the polynomial chaos expansion with active learning could construct surrogate models for structural analysis at low computational cost. The applicability of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to surrogate modeling has often been validated [11–14]. GPR [15] is a nonparametric regression method and does not require the determination of the model configuration; moreover, the number of hyperparameters required for the estimation is small, and it can be applied to nonlinear input–output relationships. For instance, Su et al. [12] conducted surrogate modeling by using GPR for the reliability analysis of bridges through finite element (FE) analysis. It was shown to be more efficient and accurate than the polynomial function-based response surface method.　Avendaño et al. [14] constructed a GPR surrogate model that effectively predicts wind turbine loads with accuracy of 4% error or less. Adaptive learning method for GPR [16–22] have also been studied for efficient surrogate modeling of the structural reliability analysis, as surveyed by Moustapha et al. [23]. Adaptive learning is the method of incorporating additional learning points into the training data by evaluating the learning function. Some studies, e.g., EGRA by Bichon et al. [16] and AK-MCS by Echard et al. [17], successfully reduced the computational cost of surrogate modeling by implement adaptive sampling to the GPR. Since the AK-MCS was presented, Adaptive Kriging has been studied actively, e.g., AK-IS by Echard et al. [21] and AK-SS by Huang et al. [22]. Many studies on surrogate modeling have been conducted, although most of them can be applied only to target calculations. However, evaluations through numerical calculations to support decision-making in the engineering field require many similar calculations. The use of the surrogate model in such scenarios will require new training data for the same modeling procedure for each calculation. In other words, a surrogate model and its outputs cannot be used to construct other surrogate models.
Transfer learning (TL) is a machine learning technique in which the knowledge learned in a problem is utilized in the target problem [24]. TL is expected to be applicable to the surrogate modeling of a target numerical calculation that shows any similarity to the source numerical calculation for which a surrogate model is already available; this approach may reduce the computational costs of constructing new surrogate models. Some cases require the repetition of numerical calculations for evaluations in the civil structural engineering field. For instance, when the target calculation is the performance analysis of an existing structure with damages, the surrogate model of the numerical calculation for the initial undamaged condition is expected to be used as the source in the TL. The other is the seismic performance analysis of a structure considering various input earthquake loads. Once a surrogate model for an input earthquake load is constructed, it can be used to construct the surrogate models for other earthquake loads with similar characteristics. If the TL works effectively in these cases, the total computational cost of the structural performance evaluation is expected to be reduced.
Some previous studies have used TL in surrogate modeling. Xiong et al. applied TL to the deep learning model for the thermal analysis of spacecraft [25]. Kaya and Hajimirza applied ANN with TL to the optimization problem of thin-film multilayer solar cells [26]. Tian et al. used TL to construct the variable-fidelity surrogate model with a deep neural network for the buckling analysis of a composite shell with seven design variables and a hierarchical reinforced shell with nine design variables [27]. In all verifications, the prediction errors of the constructed surrogate models that used TL were significantly reduced. However, the studies [25–27] in which TL was used for the surrogate model assumed that the source and target data in TL are similar from the beginning of the process. In TL, the negative transfer problem is known to occur in some cases. Negative transfer refers to the issue wherein the performance of a machine learning model decreases owing to TL when the similarity between the source and target data, i.e., the input–output relationships between the source and target numerical calculations, is low [24]. For the use of TL with confidence, the possibility of this negative transfer must be considered when it is generally unknown whether the source and target numerical calculations are similar to each other.
In the engineering field, it is generally required to explain the results of physics numerical calculations for their appropriate use, i.e., provide explanations for the results from the viewpoint of validity of the modeling; this requirement applies to surrogate models as well. The issue in most machine learning techniques, which are applicable to surrogate modeling, is that the training and prediction process is a black box. In the structural performance analysis using surrogate models, it is essential to know which uncertainties of the structural properties contribute significantly to the demand output to provide the explainability of the surrogate model. A previous study mentioned the necessity of demonstrating the explainability of the surrogate model. Golparvar et al. [28] constructed a surrogate model for predicting the offshore wind power using GPR with an automatic relevance determination (ARD) kernel, which can estimate the contributions to the input parameters by the hyperparameters in the ARD kernel. The ARD kernel [29,30] is the kernel function to represent the correlation function in the Gaussian process (GP) model, which can assign different weights to each input dimension, and the corresponding length-scale is larger for input dimensions that are irrelevant to the output. Wipf and Nagarajan [30] showed that ARD can be applied to the linear model estimation problem, where the inputs are sparse relative to the output, while retaining the estimation accuracy. Owing to this feature, it is expected that the construction of GPR surrogate models with an ARD kernel can estimate the parameter contribution to the output. However, very few studies have provided the explainability of the use of a machine learning technique to surrogate modeling, especially in the structural engineering field. Furthermore, no study has considered both TL and explainability in surrogate models.
This paper develops surrogate modeling using GPR with TL (TL-GPRSM). GPR is also applicable to the surrogate modeling of structural performance analysis, because it can deal with nonlinear input–output relationships that may possibly emerge in the required structural analysis. In addition, as GPR is a nonparametric method, the number of model parameters to be determined can be relatively low when compared with that of other regression methods. Here, TL reduces the computational cost of surrogate modeling for structural performance analysis by considering the similarity in the input–output relationships in the numerical analysis. We also propose the use of the ARD kernel for providing the explainability of the constructed surrogate model and confidence assurance of TL. The appropriately estimated ARD kernel hyperparameters are expected to be useful in evaluating the degree of the TL effect in each target surrogate modeling and solving the issue of negative transfer.
In this paper, the overviews of GPR and TL are presented, and the TL-GPRSM is formulated. Then, two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of TL-GPRSM. The first is the live-load performance evaluation analysis of a steel plate girder bridge. Here, the target domain is the maximum stress evaluation of the bridge with corrosion damages, and the source domain is that of the bridge in the initial undamaged condition. The second case study is on the seismic performance evaluation of a seismic isolation bridge pier that requires nonlinear time-history analysis. Here, the target domain is the maximum displacement evaluation of the bridge pier and rubber bearing with the input as the recorded earthquake ground motion, and the source domain contains the inputs of ground motions provided in the design standard. The effectiveness of the TL-GPRSM is verified based on the accuracy of the constructed surrogate models and effect of computational cost reductions. In addition, the contribution of TL is discussed using the similarity evaluation based on ARD. Further, the contributions of uncertain parameters estimated through ARD to the output are validated using structural engineering observations.

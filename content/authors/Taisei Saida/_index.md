I am Taisei Saida, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the University of Tsukuba. My research centers on the development and application of surrogate models in structural engineering. My primary research interests include structural reliability analysis, structural health monitoring systems, and the implementation of machine learning techniques in civil engineering applications.
